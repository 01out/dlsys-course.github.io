The schedule is tentative and can subject to change.
We will have guest lectures and may accomodate the schedule accordingly.

The normal course hour is Thuesday/Thursday. We will have two joint course session
with CSE548 (Computer architecture) on ASICs and FPGA. These two courses will
happen on Wed/Friday instead (see the schedule for details).
